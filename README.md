# Formidable-Grid

Author: Mohammad Rayati

## Init project

1. You need to install `make`: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install make`
2. Then, run `make install-all` or `make venv-activate` if everything is already installed.
3. If you delete your `.venv`, you can run `make install-all` to install everything from beginning.

## Start the project

Use docker services and native containers for development:
```sh
make start # it opens three pane (servers, development frontend, and development backend)
```
